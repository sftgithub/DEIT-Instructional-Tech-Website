							<h4>Mobile Technologies Policy Statement</h4>
							<p>
								DEIT's overarching goal is to encourage authentic, engaging active student learning with technologies that facilitate collaboration, creative problem solving, and/or the development of higher-order thinking skills. We welcome technologies that support and enhance student learning.
							</p>
							<p>
								In keeping with our goal, DeSales avoids new technology adoptions merely to be in vogue or to win honors. Our technology adoptions and applications are linked to important program goals, course objectives, and learner outcomes. Mobile technologies including smart phones, laptops, iPads, and iPod Touches have been found to meet some important goals. These and other mobile devices are characterized by their electronic, portable, and data networking capabilities.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our general policy is to allow for the use of mobile devices that support teaching and learning; however, instructors have the option to limit or ban devices at their discretion at any time that they deem the devices disruptive. Any applications (or apps) requirements for instruction must follow the same procedures as the adoption process for other course resources. DEIT cannot purchase apps on behalf of divisions, programs, or departments.
							</p>
							<p>
								DEIT is committed to helping faculty incorporate technology seamlessly into instruction. To that end, DEIT provides:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Complete support for faculty technology innovation and new large-scale implementations</li>
								<li>Classroom etiquette models and guidance for dealing with disruptions</li>
								<li>Expectation documents and syllabus statement examples to foster positive use of technology</li>
								<li>Pedagogy and technology-related professional development workshops and community discussions</li>
							</ul>
