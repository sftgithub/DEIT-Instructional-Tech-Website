							<h4>Tips for Mobile Device Owners</h4>
							<p>
								DeSales is committed to helping students use technology effectively, professionally, and ethically.  To that end, here are some learner expectations and pointers to keep in mind in class:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Arrive early and turn off device sounds before class begins.</li>
								<li>Stay on task. Surfing, texting, and gaming are distractions to you and to others.</li>
								<li>Respect others' and your own privacy. Do not open social media sites, WebAdvisor, Online Bill Pay, or email during class.</li>
								<li>Have a back-up plan in case technology (or battery) fails.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="bold">Additional owner guidance:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Never leave devices unattended or exposed to heat especially from direct sunlight or a closed car.</li>
								<li>Enable the passcode feature on the mobile device to protect data. Avoid storing credit card numbers or social security numbers on devices.</li>
								<li>No university-wide policy exists for buying device apps. iTunes requires a credit card.</li>
								<li>DEIT provides very limited technical support for mobile devices including smart phones.</li>
							</ul>
